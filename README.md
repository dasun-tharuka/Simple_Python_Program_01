### Simple_Python_Program_01 
---

Design a Python program to input specified number of positive integers (maximum of 10 numbers). Only positive integer numbers are allowed. Proper error messages must be displayed for incorrect inputs. Once all the numbers are entered,

  1. User must be able to get the highest number when “Highest Value‟ option is selected.
  2. User must be able to get the lowest number when “Lowest Value‟ option is selected.
  3. User must be able to get the average of all the numbers when “Average Value‟ option is selected.
  4. User must be able to filter and display all the even numbers when “Filter Even‟ option is selected


Algorithm :

1. Start
2. Initialize variables.
3. Get/Ask for the option of the Main menu. 
4. If the option is 1 then can enter the numbers (maximum 10 numbers) or else Display this message as “First, you need to input numbers 
from 'Option 1' ”.
5. Check the input numbers are positive integers or else Display an error message. And If option 1 is a success then go to step 3, else repeat 
step 4 through step 5.
6. If the option is 2 then find and display the highest value of the numbers and go to step 3.
7. If the option is 3 then find and display the lowest value of the numbers and go to step 3.
8. If the option is 4 then find and display the average value of the numbers and go to step 3.
9. If the option is 5 then filter and display the even numbers of the numbers list and go to step 3.
10. If the option is 6 then ask whether user wants to continue or not with another option. if user wants to continue, go to step 3.
11. If user want to Exit go to step 12
12. Stop
